I worked in VUIT Finance and Payroll which were responsible for finance and payroll
systems at ICA. There I was a system architect in the team Tech and Integration
which primarily was responsible for the technology required for integration between
finance and payroll systems and to make sure the data that flows between them
always goes where it is supposed to.

In the role as the team's software architect I actively took part in developing
solutions in Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript and React as well as being responsible
for the team's software architecture and I was the team's spokesperson when
collaboration and planning with other enterprise and solution architects were required.

In larger initiatives I also acted as a technical project leader where I collected
demands from stakeholders and coordinated with other teams at ICA in projects that
demanded joint delivery.

My responsibilities also consisted of among other things:

- Informing the team's product owner of development status, clarify technical
  details in ongoing projects and together set the technical vision for the future.
- Working with system engineers to understand and gather relevant technical details
  for systems at ICA and update Jira with necessary information so that all
  developer's work could continue.
- Representing the team in different architecture forums with the opportunity to
  take part in defining the overall software architecture at ICA.
- Communicating with business analysts and other stakeholders and explain the
  possibilities the team had in helping them in the solutions they seek and
  together define epics and break them down into stories for developers.
