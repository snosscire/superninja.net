I work in VUIT Finance and Payroll which are responsible for finance and payroll
systems at ICA. There I am a system architect in the
team Tech and Integration which primarily is responsible for the
technology required for integration between finance and payroll systems
and to make sure the data that flows between them always goes where it is supposed to.

In the role as the team's software architect I actively take part in developing
solutions in Java, Spring Boot, TypeScript and React as well as being responsible for
the team's software architecture and I am the team's spokesperson when
collaboration and planning with other enterprise and solution architects are required.

In larger initiatives I also act as a technical project leader where I collect
demands from stakeholders and coordinate with other teams at ICA in projects that
demand joint delivery.

My responsibilities also consists of among other things:

- Inform the team's product owner of development status, clarify technical
details in ongoing projects and together set the technical vision for the future.
- Work with system engineers to understand and gather relevant technical details for systems at ICA and
update Jira with necessary information so that all developer's work can continue.
- Represent the team in different architecture forums with the opportunity to take part in defining
the overall software architecture at ICA.
- Communicate with business analysts and other stakeholders and explain the possibilities the team have in
helping them in the solutions they seek and together define epics and break them down to stories for developers.
