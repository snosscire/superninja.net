I started working at Cention in January 2008 while I was studying Object oriented
programming and development at Jensen Education. After completing the education my
employment at Cention became full time.

In the role as software developer and system administrator I developed and
maintained Cention’s products.

I also have trained and supervised Cention’s development team in Bangladesh and been
part of starting Cention’s development team in Malaysia.

My responsibilities consisted among other things of:
- Daily make sure thousands of agents in different businesses and on different continents can handle and answer hundreds of thousands of communications from their customers over e-mail, chat, SMS and social media.
- Within minutes solve problems that arise within a product as every minute of downtime means Cention’s customers lose money.
- Implement and test new features in Cention’s products which are written in a wide verity of programming languages such as C, C++, Ferite, Golang, JavaScript, HTML.
- Daily monitor all the different installations of Cention’s products to adapt and optimize them for Cention’s growing customers.
- Work together with Cention’s development team in Malaysia and supervise them in their work.
