As part of a team of three software developers I helped develop a demo application for MyWidz.
The demo consisted of three parts.

- Web interface for administration
- Server
- Mobile client

My responsibilities were the following:

- Investigated and decided what technologies to use including how to use Linux to host future servers.
- Mobile client implemented with Java ME and related parts for communication to and from the server.
- Other network related programming.
