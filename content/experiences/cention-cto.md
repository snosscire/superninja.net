Cention provides a cloud based contact center solution delivered as
Software as a Service (SaaS) for medium sized and big businesses.

In Mars 2019 my role as Chief Technology Officer was formalized to reflect the role and
responsibility I’ve had for many years.

In my role I have the technical responsibility for Cention’s products and provide
the overall technical vision for Cention.

When I took on the role as Chief Technology Officer I added among other things
the following responsibilities on top of the ones I already had as a
software developer.

- Be responsible for the overall system architecture that is the foundation for the development of new features that are implemented by Cention’s development team in Malaysia.
- Represent Cention in technical questions with customers, sales representatives and external partners and specify their needs.
